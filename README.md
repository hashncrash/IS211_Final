Final Project: Book Catalog
GI already work in data and haved worked in a library before and databases, apis, and queries. I chose to complete the Project Option 1, which involved creating a book catalogue.

Overview
Interface
I used Flasked ttuotiral and youtube to find answers
When starting the app, the user will be taken to the login screen, which has links to the index (homepage), isbn lookup, and login pages. I was able to only allow the user to use the lookup function by being logged in. The login page is not located on the main page, but the user is directed to the login page by either using the link in the menu, or within the text.

Login Display
when logged in, the user will be presented with their book catalog (library) if any books have been entered. If the library is empty, the table will display a message recommending the user to lookup ISBN.

After they add the books, they will be displayed with the requirements.


Conclusion
I enjoyed working on this project, given my lack of experience with web developing. I would like to continue working on dev projects.
